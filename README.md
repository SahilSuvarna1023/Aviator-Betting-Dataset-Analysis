# Aviator-Betting-Dataset-Analysis
This project analyzes the Aviator betting dataset, focusing on profitable betting strategies using historical data, machine learning, and statistical analysis.
ðŸ“– Overview

This project analyzes betting payouts using machine learning, fraud detection, and clustering. It leverages historical betting data to predict future payouts, detect anomalies, and classify betting behaviors into meaningful clusters.

ðŸ“Š Key Features

Data Cleaning & Preprocessing: Handles missing values, duplicates, and formats timestamps.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Provides insights into payout distributions, trends, and correlations.

Machine Learning Models:

Random Forest & XGBoost for payout prediction.

Performance Evaluation using MAE, RMSE, and RÂ² score.

Fraud Detection: Uses Isolation Forest to flag suspicious payouts.

Clustering Analysis: Applies K-Means to group users based on betting behavior.

Visualizations: Time series trends, correlation heatmaps, fraud detection plots, and clustering insights.

ðŸ—‚ Dataset

The dataset consists of betting transactions with the following key features:

id: Unique identifier for each transaction.

created_at: Timestamp of the bet.

payout: Amount won (target variable).

app: Betting platform or app used.

Feature Engineered Variables: Lag payouts for ML models.

ðŸš€ How to Use
